# Detection of epiliptec seizures using machine learning methods
Epileptic seizures occur as a result of brain functional dysfunction and can affect the health of the
patient. Prediction of epileptic seizures before the onset is very useful for the prevention of seizures
through medication. Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals are used to detect & predict epileptic seizures
using machine learning techniques and feature extractions. Nevertheless, the pre-processing of
EEG signals for noise removal and extraction of features are two major problems which have an
adverse effect on both anticipation time and true positive prediction performance. Taking this into
consideration, the proposed model will provide remarkable methods for both preprocessing and extraction
of features. The model detects various brain states and accounts for both epileptic seizures
detection and prediction. Using the EEG CHB-MIT dataset, the SVM model was trained, tested
and compared, having a best true positive percentage of 0.91 for a single patient and 0.82 for
multiple patients. The SVM algorithm was also compared to other machine learning ones, with its
results being better than all used in comparison.
